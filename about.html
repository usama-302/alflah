        <h1 class="history-title">Our History</h1>
        <div class="history-content">
            <p>In early 1950s, Mr Muhammad Aslam Butt started off as a small manufacturer of flat woven fabric on hand
                looms. A few years later this manufacturing process was switched on power looms then pile fabric
                (velvet) in 1960. In order to be the leader and to produce the best quality velvet fabric, it was
                realized that innovative professional work force, technology, and raw material (yarn) must go hand in
                hand. So Asia Spinning Mills (acrylic yarn spinning) and Kashmir Woolen Mills (carpet yarn spinning)
                came into existence in 1973 and 1975 respectively. Best available professionals and skilled workforce
                were hired to stay ahead of the competition. As the time progressed, we acquired the best technology
                available in our field. It is an admitted fact that we have the most modern equipment (machinery)
                available in Pakistan at present. We try to stay at least 15 years ahead of our competition and let them
                follow us.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, ever since its inception in 1960 we have directed all of our efforts and resources in
                developing the best quality products. It is our constant endeavor to raise standards in designing and in
                quality. While creating new designs, our designers keep in mind the varied moods, colors and aesthetic
                look which will have soothing effect on us. All of our products are designed with only one thing in mind
                â€“ you!</p>
